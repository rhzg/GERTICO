1. Installation
===============

The binary distribution of GERTICO consists of a single archive. After
extracting this archive you will see a directory which contains GERTICO and
some third party libraries.

Linux Installation
------------------
Unpack the compressed gertico file and copy its contents to any directory
(e.g. /usr/local). Two environment variables are needed:

	GERTICO has to point to the gertico directory (e.g. GERTICO=/usr/local/gertico)
	
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH has to point to the dynamic libraries of Gertico
	(e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$GERTICO/lib)


Windows Installation
--------------------
Extract the archive to a directory of your choice (e.g. C:\programfiles).
Before you can use GERTICO you must set the environment variable

	GERTICO=C:\programfiles\gertico
	
and add directory %GERTICO%\bin to the search path so that GERTICO's
executables and DLLs can be found by the operating system.

Warning: Make sure that no other directory is in your search path which contains
the ACE/TAO DLLs, e.g. DMSO RTI NG1.3! If a different version of ACE/TAO than
the one required by GERTICO is used, library symbols cannot be resolved and
your program will not start!

Then you must adapt the configuration file "GERTICOconf.xml" to your
configuration as described below.


2. Configuration
================

Gertico is configured in the file GERTICOconf.xml which is in the gertico 
directory. There are two entries which have to be adapted:

The endpoint is the ip address and port of the machine where the Corba 
NamingService is running (see chapter 3). 

 	<endPoint>corbaloc:iiop:192.168.240.107:3000</endPoint>
 
On Windows you must use the fully qualified host name instead of the numeric ip
address. If the hostname cannot be resolved add it to the "hosts" file in
directory C:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc. If you don't need to run a federation
execution on several computers, you can use "localhost" instead of a fully
qualified host name and run the NamingService, GeRti and all federates on the
same computer.
	
The ModelPath is the directory where your fed files are located.

 <ModelPath>/home/user_1/FED</ModelPath>
 

3. Starting Gertico
===================

First of all you have to start the Corba NamingService which is in the 
gertico/bin directory:

	Naming_Service -ORBEndpoint iiop://192.168.240.107:3000 -d
	(-d is optional for verbose mode)
	
The parameter "-ORBEndpoint iiop://192.168.240.107:3000" is the ipaddress (with 
defined port number) of the machine where the NamingService is running.
	
Then gertico has to be started:

	> cd $GERTICO/bin
	> gerti1516
	Starting GERTICO server
	Server is running
	
Please wait until the message "Server is running" appears.

The Corba NamingService needs the complete hostname with its domainname of each 
computer where a federate is running. So make sure that all ip addresses can be 
resolved by a DNS server or an entry in /etc/hosts.


4. Building applications
========================

The binary distribution contains a few example programs.

Building applications on Linux
------------------------------
For building applications please have a look at the Makefile in 
gertico/samples/helloworld. Applications have to be linked with following 
libraries:

RTI_INCD = $(GERTICO)/include

RTI_LIBD = -L$(GERTICO)/lib

RTI_LIBS = \
   -lrtimap \
   -lGeRTI_v1_0_CORBA \
   -lgertitm \
   -lgertimom \
   -lgertiown \
   -lOMT_XML \
   -lgertiut \
   -lrtiidl \
   -lgal \
   -lTAO \
   -lACE \
   -lTAO_CosNaming \
   -lxerces-c \
   -lFedtimeDouble \
   -lRTI_Exceptions

	 
Building applications on Windows
--------------------------------
In order to build your own federates on Windows you need Visual C++ 6.0 with
Service Pack 5 or higher. Code generation mus be set to "Multithreaded DLL
debugging" and the Run-Time Type Identification (RTTI) must be enabled.

The GERTICO header files are in %GERTICO%\include and libraries are in
%GERTICO%\lib. Applications must be linked with LRCd.lib and FedTimeDoubleD.lib
